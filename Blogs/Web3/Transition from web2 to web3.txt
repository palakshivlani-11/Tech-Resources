The internet is evolving from Web 2 to Web 3, indicating a shift towards the future of digital technology. I’ll offer an introduction to some key theoretical concepts on blockchain and web3, aimed at providing a foundational understanding of these topics.

Web3.0 is founded upon three guiding principles that distinguish it as a revolutionary evolution from its predecessor, Web2.0.
1. Control — Ownership of data
2. Composability — interoperability with each other
3. Decentralization — distribution of power and control

Blockchain technology lies at the core of web3, and is designed to operate without relying on traditional trust mechanisms. This is why web3 is often referred to as a “trustless combination”.The foundation of web3 is a transparent ledger called a blockchain, which is a decentralized and distributed database. It operates by validating transactions through multiple nodes and securely storing them, ensuring accessibility to all participants.

You may be curious about the role of a ledger in this context and what it entails. Let’s delve into what a ledger is and how it fits into the picture
So , A ledger in a blockchain is a decentralized and transparent database that securely stores transactional data across a network of computers or nodes. Participants in the network collectively maintain the ledger, eliminating the need for a central authority.

The primary characteristic of a blockchain ledger is its immutability and resistance to tampering. Once a transaction is recorded in the ledger, it becomes extremely challenging, if not impossible, to modify or erase the stored information. This inherent feature guarantees the integrity and dependability of the data contained within the ledger.

Now , we know that blockchain deals with transaction among various nodes , consensus mechanism plays a vital role here.
Consensus mechanisms refer to the protocols and algorithms employed to establish consensus among network participants regarding the validity and order of transactions, forming the foundation of blockchain’s functionality Their vital role lies in facilitating agreement among multiple participants in a distributed network regarding the validity and sequencing of transactions. By employing consensus mechanisms, blockchain networks ensure that decentralized nodes collectively reach a consensus on the state and integrity of the blockchain.
Listing some consensus mechanism :

Proof of Work (POW) : PoW necessitates miners to utilize computational power to solve intricate mathematical puzzles. By solving these puzzles, miners validate transactions and append new blocks to blockchain.The miner who first solves the puzzle receives a reward in form of tokens or cryptocurrency
Proof of Stake (POS) : In PoS,validators are selected based on the quantity of cryptocurrency they possess and are willing to use as collateral, referred to as their stake. The likelihood of a validator being chosen to create a new block in PoS is directly correlated to their stake .
In recent years, blockchain technology has seen significant advancements, leading to the emergence of various blockchain platforms. Ethereum is a notable example that extends beyond digital currency functionality. It serves as a versatile platform capable of supporting diverse use cases such as the development of decentralized applications and the creation of self-executing smart contracts.
